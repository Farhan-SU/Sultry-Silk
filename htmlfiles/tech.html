                <div class="intro">
                    <p>3D printing permits fashion designers to expand beyond the traditional 
                        boundaries of design, allowing them to turn some of the most challenging
                        design concepts into reality. Without the need for a specific mold, designers
                        are free to create intricate geometries and structures with extreme accuracy, 
                        clean cuts and sealed fabric edges to prevent fraying. Another benefit is that
                        one method can be used to cut many different materials, like silk, nylon, 
                        leather, neoprene, polyester and cotton. There are no unintended marks left on
                        the fabric, which is particularly beneficial for delicate fabrics like silk and
                        lace.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are three main types of lasers used for laser cutting: the CO2 laser, the
                        neodymium (Nd) laser and the neodymium yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser. 
                        For the most part, the CO2 laser is the method of choice when it comes to cutting
                        wearable fabrics. This particular process involves firing a high-energy laser that
                        cuts by melting, burning or vaporizing material. To accomplish the precise cut, a 
                        laser travels through a tube-like device while being reflected by several mirrors.
                        The beam eventually reaches a focal lens, which targets the laser to a single spot
                        on the chosen material for cutting. Adjustments can be made to vary the amount of 
                        material that is cut by the laser.

        <p>Designers have begun experimenting with 3D printed pieces of clothing and in doing 
            so are exploring a new philosophy of sustainable fashion. As it stands, the fashion 
            industry is the third largest consumer of water, coming in just behind the charming 
            likes of big oil and corporate paper. This is due to unsustainable cotton farming 
            practices and constant irrigation requirements which are a serious, ongoing environmental
             threat and incredibly damaging.
        <br>
        <br>
        3D printing changes all of that as 3D printing inherently eliminates waste. Items are created
         one layer at a time with extreme specificity. Fabric for clothing doesn’t need to be rolled out 
         by the meter, then cut and stitched, instead it’s printed and ready to wear. 
         <br>
         <br>
         In an interview with<a href="https://www.purible.com/stories/3Dprinting">Purible</a>, Jennifer Howard,
        PR rep for Brooklyn based 3D printing house MakerBot, says “The ability to [3D] print clothing equals
        a huge reduction in shipping and transportation needs. Fashion manufacturing, at any level, means you
        have to factor in materials, transport, and packaging all of which require fuel, natural resources 
        and time.” Howard also explains that the PLA used by many 3D printers is from sustainably sourced plastic
        saying, “The PLA material we use at MakerBot is a bioplastic made from corn.” In addition to that, PLA 
        is also reusable; it can be melted down and recycled as the user sees fits.

        <div class="ivh_intro"> 
    <p>Take the work of Iris van Herpen, the Amsterdam-based Dutch designer at the vanguard of high tech couture.
        For Iris van Herpen is what you might call a cerebral designer. She is endlessly interested in new ideas,
        in the interface between fashion and architecture, fashion and music, and fashion and technology. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In an interview with <a href="https://howtospendit.ft.com/womens-style/204883-the-other-worldly-couture-of-iris-van-herpen">Lucia van der Post </a>“If fashion were only about consumerism and functionality, it would be dead...Fashion is
        not only about wearability, it’s also about hopes and dreams, about history, the future, who we are, where
        we want to go. It is about finding new ways of being feminine.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        She became the first designer to ever present a 3D printed dress on a runway—the piece was subsequently 
        named one of 2011’s best inventions by Time magazine. She uses techniques such as injection moulding, 
        laser cutting, 3D printing, and intricate handwork. 3D printing makes it possible to create shapes without
        a mould, which has in turn made it possible for van Herpen to achieve incredibly intricate and complex 
        geometries in her garments — one of the defining characteristic of her work.

            The Dutch designer presented her latest collection, titled Hypnosis, on 1 July 2019 at Élysée
            Montmartre in Paris for the city’s Haute Couture fashion week. Comprised of 19 different, 
            multilayered looks, Hypnosis aims to reflect “the beauty and complexity of our environment” 
            by mimicking the delicate patterns and structures found in nature. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This season Iris van Herpen collaborated with American kinetic sculptor Anthony Howe, using a 
            combination of engineering and craftsmanship, the collection brings together elegant materials,
            such as luminous silk organza and duchesse-satin, with structural elements of aluminum and 
            stainless steel. The show was staged around a spherical Omniverse sculpture powered by wind, 
            where models passed through as they walked down the runway. The designer said she was compelled 
            by the way its arching vertebrae, spinning on a curving axis, simultaneously expand and contract.
            Howe’s spherical ‘Omniverse’ sculpture explores “…Our relationship with nature and intertwines with 
            infinite expansion and contraction, expressing a universal life cycle”.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the key pieces of the collection, the finale ‘Infinity’ dress which appears to be continuously 
            in motion came to life at the end of the show. A mechanism made from aluminum, stainless steel and bearings
            forms the skeleton of the dress which is embroidered with a delicate layering of feathers in cyclical flight;
            revolving around their own center. Representing the epitome of avant garde haute contour, Iris Van Herpen has
            once again transformed fashion and technology into artistic ecstasy. Discover more of her Hypnosis collection
