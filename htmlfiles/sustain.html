      <h2>What is Sustainable Fashion</h2>
       <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
    <div class="sus_big_intro">
       <div class="sus_intro1">
            <p>Sustainable fashion is partly about producing clothes, shoes and 
            accessories in environmentally and socio-economically sustainable 
            manners, but also about more sustainable patterns of consumption
            and use, which necessitate shifts in individual attitudes and behavior.
            But despite the growing interest in sustainability issues within the 
            fashion industry, currently there is no common definition of what 
            sustainable fashion actually means. As a starting point, Green Strategy 
            has developed the following definition of “more sustainable fashion”:</p>
       </div>
       <div class="quote">
            "More sustainable fashion can be defined as clothing, shoes and acces-
            sories that are manufactured, marketed and used in the most sustain-
            able manner possible, taking into account both environmental and 
            socio-economic aspects. In practice, this implies continuous work to 
            improve all stages of the product’s life cycle, from design, raw material 
            production, manufacturing, transport, storage, marketing and final 
            sale, to use, reuse, repair, remake and recycling of the product and its 
            components. From an environmental perspective, the aim should be to 
            minimize any undesirable environmental effect of the product’s life 
            cycle by: (a) ensuring efficient and careful use of natural resources 
            (water, energy, land, soil, animals, plants, biodiversity, ecosystems, 
            etc); (b) selecting renewable energy sources (wind, solar, etc) at every 
            stage, and (c) maximizing repair, remake, reuse, and recycling of the 
            product and it's components. From a socio-economic perspective, all 
            stakeholders should work to improve present working conditions for 
            workers on the field, in the factories, transportation chain, and stores, 
            by aligning with good ethics, best practice and international codes of 
            conduct. In addition, fashion companies should contribute to encour-
            age more sustainable consumption patterns, caring and washing 
            practices, and overall attitudes to fashion." (Green Strategy, June 2014).

       <div class="sus_intro2">
            <p>There’s the fact that the climate crisis has 
            become a much bigger issue since Stella 
            McCartney launched her label. It’sone of 
            the major issues of the 2020 Democratic pri-
            maries, for example.) Kering, for its <span class="runoff">part, has 
            put a focus on combating climate change 
            since 2012, when it appointed a chief sustainability
            officer. LVMH has had a Corporate 
            Environment Director since the early ’90s, 
            and integrated their corporate environmental 
            initiatives program LIFE into the strategic 
            plans of each of their fashion brands in 2015.</span></p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <div class="stella_text1">
                        <p>The invitation for Stella McCartney’s fashion show in Paris came in a glossy
                            pouch with “I am 100% compostable (and so are you!)” printed on it. Inside
                            was a freebie with purpose: a pair of yellow socks made from 85% upcycled
                            yarn using no water, chemicals, dyes or pesticides. In a socially conscious 
                            climate in which more and more fashion brands are pledging their commitment
                            to sustainability, such details matter.
                        <br>
                        <br>          
                            A consistently fresh aesthetic is underpinned by the designer’s attention to 
                            detail and dedicated approach to ethical fashion.Born in September 1971 to former
                            Beatle Paul McCartney and musician, photographer and animal rights activist Linda 
                            McCartney, McCarthy's commitment to using cruelty free, organic and recycled materials
                            in its designs has inspired much of the indsutry to follow her footstep.
                        </p>
                        
                           <p>In 2018, the brand launched Stella's World of Sustainability which is a platform dedicated
                            to sharing the journey to achieving a more sustainable fashion business. As a brand, they don't
                            test on animals, nor do they use fur or leather. They recently revealed a collaboration with 
                            Colorifix, who have "innovated a process that dramatically reduces the environmental impact of 
                            the dyeing process." As well as a partnership with BOLT Threads, which is a "breakthrough biotech
                            company, to create the next generation of advanced luxury materials."
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Sustainability shapes the company’s policies, its 
                            underlying business model. As stated by Stella McCarthy
                            on her <a href="https://www.stellamccartney.com/experience/en/sustainability/reducing-our-impacts/">website</a>
                            "We use the Environmental Profit and Loss (EP&L) to measure and understand our impact on the environment. But 
                            measuring is just the first step, it’s what we do with the information that matters."
                            In 2012, the design label diverted 34.3 metric tons of waste from landfill and recycled or reused – they 
                            recycle all textiles that could be used. Moreover, all her offices and studios in the UK are powered by wind energy
                            and abroad, they use renewable energy to power their stores.</p>

        <p> McCarthy’s Spring 2020, according to her press notes, is her most sustainably made 
            collection yet, with more than 75 percent of materials being eco-friendly. She told WWD 
            her spring 2020 collection was “inspired by all of the fierce women, past, present and 
            future, who aren’t afraid to make the world their own. The free spirits, the wild ones, 
            the artists and the risk takers.”

            <br>
            The viscose dresses, printed with hand-painted landscape scenes, 
            started life as raw material extracted from sustainably managed forests in Norway and Sweden,
             the shirred denim dress is colored with non-chemical dye, and the elaborate black-and-white 
             Western-look tooled appliqué technique on a pair of wicked-looking pin-heeled pumps was achieved 
             with non-animal glue. You can read more about all of Stella's groundbreaking sustainability initives

                By 2050, textile production is slated to account for 25% of our global carbon emissions, 
                and DÔEN recent partnership with The RealReal—following the footstep of Stella McCarthy—shows
                the company’s stride to creating a more sustaible fashion landscape. Compnies like DÔEN are 
                embracing this new upward trend of resale market and consignment stores and applauds consumer 
                for supporting a circular economy. By recycling and reusing clothing, this can greatly reduce 
                its carbon footprint by up to 82%.

                Founded by sisters Margaret and Katherine Kleveland, the LA-based line is  filled with timeless pieces
                that are invitingly easy to wear. Their commitment to conserving resources and fabrics has earned the 
                respect of many people that learning about the enviromental footprints of the fashion industry and the 
                support of companies like Patagonia in their slow fashion & sustainability movements. DÔEN embrace a 
                “fewer, better things” mentality in regards to consumption. By making quality, timeless pieces, they ensure 
                that they can be worn season after season. The timless pieces leads to less consumption, ultimately helping
                the industry spend less energy and resources towards the production of their clothings.
