                            There are few who cut as recognisable a silhouette as Karl Lagerfeld. His ponytailed silver 
                            hair tied, always, with a velvet ribbon, oversized sunglasses, high-collar shirts, Hedi Slimane 
                            suits and cut-off black leather driving gloves were as distinctive as personal aesthetics come. 
                            He’s one of the most prolific designer of the 20th and 21st centry, he is regarded as someone who 
                            defined contemporary luxury fashion industry and was known for his renaissance-like intelligence 
                            When presenting Mr.Lagerfiled with the Outstanding Achievement Award at the British Fashion Awards 
                            in 2015, Anna Wintour, editor of American Vogue, said: 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                “More than anyone I know, he represents the 
                                soul of fashion: restless, forward-looking and voraciously attentive to our changing culture.” 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Karl Lagerfiled was a fashion polygot, held the creative director position of Fendi since 1965 
                                making him the longest-standing creative director of a fashion house. His work at Fendi from 1967 
                                saw him revitalise the leather goods brand.

                                His indelible presence in Fendi was ,however, just the 
                                begining as his greatest influence lies in his time as a creative director of Chanel from 1983 to 
                                present day. In 1982, he chairman of Chanel, Alain Wertheimer asked him to design for the house 
                                during a time when Chanel stared to loose its crowd because of their traditional style. But Mr.Lagerfiled 
                                saw this as a challenge and went on to ressurect the brand with his youthful designs while paying homage
                                to the Chanel herself, subverting her ideals with his own modern take on her most renowned designs. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                His great talent was his ability to identify, articulate, and frequently anticipate changes in the zeitgeist. Chanel had 
                                revolutionised fashion following the First World War by adapting traditional unstructured menswear shapes and 
                                fabrics (such as tweed and ticking) and repurposing them for womenswear.

                                “Lagerfeld’s drive, ambition and clarity 
                                of vision enabled him to take on not just multiple collections each season, but numerous fashion houses, defining 
                                each with his ability to combine a unique identity with an overriding sense of the present”, says The Courtauld 
                                Institute’s Rebecca Arnold.

            <h2>Christian Dior</h2>
            <div class="row">

                    Christian Dior, French fashion reinvigorated the post-war Parisian fashion 
                    industry, with his extravagant use of fabric and flamboyant silhouettes which established the
                    fashion empire as a symbol of class and grace. From 1937, Dior was employed by the fashion 
                    designer Robert Piguet, who gave him the opportunity to design for three Piguet collections. 
                    Dior would later say that 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “Robert Piguet taught me the virtues of simplicity through which 
                    true elegance must come”. Blending simplicity with elegance, he created many signature looks 
                    of the 20th century that were loved by everyone from celebrities to Princess Diana and the 
                    Royal Family. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Dior’s iconic jacket, “Le Bar” and collection of swirling full skirts and 
                    nipped-in waists dubbed The New Look by Harper’s Bazaar became a post-war cultural symbol for 
                    what Dior himself described as ‘Youth, hope and the future.’  Immaculate tailoring and an emphasis
                    on feminine curve with soft shoulders, full busts, and willowy waists would dominate women’s 
                    fashion for the next decade. Since Dior’s passing in 1957, fashion house has seen six successors
                    from Yves Saint Laurent to Gianfranco Ferré, all of whom played an integral part in its enduring
                    popularity.

                        Yves Saint Laurent paved the way for luxury ready-to-wear as the first contour house to do so. 
                        The contour house reflected the freedom and energy of the youth through their sensual yet trendy
                        and sophisticated designs. Straight out of school at the age of 17, Christine Dior hired him on 
                        the spot in 1955 after seeing his drawings. In 1958, the 21 years old fashion prodigy exploded 
                        on the fashion scene as the world’s youngest couturier as the successor to Christian Dior, after 
                        Dior’s sudden death. His first dated sketches, which are held in the museum’s collection, go as 
                        far back as 1951 and depict sets and costumes for the theater and ballet. His legacy includes 
                        famous pieces such as Mondrian-inspired dresses, an Iris cardigan in homage to Van Gogh, safari 
                        and exotic peasant looks, and Le smoking. the Mondrian Dress features in the permanent collection
                        of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

            <p> Saint Laurent’s  was obsessed with idea of liberation and it reflected on his collections. From liberation 
                of social norms of how women wore suits to liberation of couture and traditional couturier ideals. He learned
                 the elegance of Dior’s style and adopted his own in his debut collection, spring 1958’s Trapeze line, which 
                 won him the Neiman Marcus prize. Saint Laurent created a lighter, more fluid silhouette with less fabric.
                  This would be his first time transforming the contents of the modern woman’s wardrobe and then again in 1966 
                  with the first tuxedo jacket for women in Le Smoking.
                  Saint Laurent empowered them, dressing them to compete with men in trousers. Saint Laurent was influenced by 
                  the avant-garde style of artist Niki de Saint-Phalle, who reportedly often wore men’s suits with heels. Pierre Bergé, 
                  Saint Laurent’s long-time business partner, said 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  “If Chanel gave women their freedom, it was Saint Laurent who empowered them.” 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  He was the first to popularize 
                  this aesthesis for high fashion and proved to be the catalyst for people that embraced their individuality 
                  regardless of their sex or race in the 20th century. The trouser, Le Smoking, the Safari jacket are staples of 
                  the fashion lexicon ‘til this day

                      she perfected the skill of personal aesthetics. Consequently, her courage led her to revolutionized the fashion industry by bringing nylon to

                      When Prada’s first nylon bags hit the runway in 1984, it was perceived as a radical approach 
                      to luxury and the antithesis of ’80s glamor. Speaking to Vogue, Miuccia said that her attraction to nylon 
                       came from the fact that she “hated all the bags that were around. They were so formal, so lady, so traditional,
                      so classic.” Rebelling against stalwart codes of luxury fashion has become a Prada signature. By SS95, the 
                         brand was using nylon as an alternative to silk and cashmere across garments, and it became a hallmark of the 
                         brand ’til this day.
